# Hyperparameter Analysis of MLP and CNN: Depth vs Width vs Accuracy

## Overview
This repository contains the code, datasets, and tutorial materials for analyzing the impact of **depth** and **width** on the performance of **Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The study focuses on how varying these hyperparameters affects accuracy, computational efficiency, and generalization using the **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets.

This project includes:
- Jupyter Notebook demonstrating all experiments.
- Preprocessing, training, and evaluation pipelines for MLPs and CNNs.
- Visualization of results including 3D depth-width surface plots.
- A professional tutorial report in PDF format.
- References and sources for further reading.
